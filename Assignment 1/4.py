'''Create a Python program that will have one string variable =“Welcome to Python”.
Perform following operations:
• Print whole string
• Print only first character of string
• Print 3rdcharacter to -1 character of string using slicing operator
• Print string from 4thcharacter to the end of string using slicing operator
• Print whole string 5 times using appropriate operator'''

string_var = "Welcome to Python  "

# Print whole string
print(string_var)

# Print only first character of string
print(string_var[0])

# Print 3rd character to -1 character of string using slicing operator
print(string_var[2:-1])

# Print string from 4th character to the end of string using slicing operator
print(string_var[3:])

# Print whole string 5 times using appropriate operator
print(string_var * 5)
